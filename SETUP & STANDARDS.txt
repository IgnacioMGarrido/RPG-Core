# Setup and Standards Doc

## The world Scale & Origin
We use Unity's default Terrain (1 m = 1 Unity Unit). Note animations don't scale well. 
Y = 100m is the deepest water bottom. All Terrains at Y =-100, flattern land = 100.

##Layers
So far the layers are 'Walkable' = 9 and 'Enemy' = 10.
Note the collider is the one that receives the raycast so apply this layer to children objects.

##Labels
The SceneSetup label contains prefabs that MUST be added to new Scenes.
